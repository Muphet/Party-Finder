# üéâ Party Finder Public Repository

Party Finder helps a player or a premade group of players find others to play with, based on their selected region, roles, elo, gamemode and fluent languages! Can search for players only within the server it is in or in every server the bot is in, and creates text and voice channels for the premade groups and parties, that only their respective members can see and interact with!

## üôè Contributing

I am currently in college and *Party Finder* is a side project with which - in all honesty - I hope to make some money. **I do not and will never however make Party Finder gated behind a paywall and its core features will always be available to everyone.**

On top of this, there are server hosting costs to cover.

So the solution I came up with was to offer something that isn't detrimental to those who do not want to or cannot afford to donate and at the same time valuable enough to reward and thank those who do.

For every 5$ donated you will get 1 month of Priority Queue and access to donator exclusive support channels and a special Donator tag on our Discord server.

When you are a Priority Queue subscriber, you can expect your queue times to reduce significantly, and every premade group you create also have its queue time reduced.

For any donation related questions, you can ask them in the [#donations-support](https://discord.gg/pXdXcCKJcQ) channel in our discord server.
